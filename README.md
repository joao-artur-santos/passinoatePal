A companion app powered by Open Ai's Chat GPT api, made for a 24h hackathon at Academia de CÃ³digo.

The bot can answer every prompt we guve him in a considerate and loving manner (configured by ourselves to behave romantically and give supportive advice), has text-to-speech integration, saves conversations and messages to a database for future reference, and is presented thematically within our own UI built from scratch. It also pooled from various resources to help us plan dates (with sites like The Fork or Netflix) and even let us choose from a variety of soundtracks to set the mood.
